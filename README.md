## About Me
**"Hello, my name is Kamlesh Pradhan. I have recently completed my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. During my studies, I developed strong technical skills in Python, SQL, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning, which have helped me build a solid foundation in analyzing data and deriving meaningful insights. I am particularly interested in pursuing a career as a Data Analyst, where I can apply these skills to support data-driven decision-making and contribute to organizational growth.

In addition to my academic and technical background, I am a proactive learner who enjoys exploring new technologies and keeping myself updated with industry trends. Outside of work, I like playing cricket, which has taught me teamwork and strategy, and listening to music, which helps me relax and stay creative. Overall, I aim to combine my technical expertise, analytical mindset, and passion for learning to grow as a successful Data Analyst."**

Thank You.....
