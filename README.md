## About Me
"Hi, Iâ€™m Kamlesh Pradhan. I have completed my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI & ML. I have skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. Currently, I am interning at Ramana Soft as a Data Science Intern with a focus on Generative AI, where I am gaining practical exposure to real-world applications of data and AI. Earlier, I also worked on projects like Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and ARIMA, Vehicle Detection using OpenCV, and Cat vs Dog Classification using CNN. I am now looking forward to building my career as a Data Analyst, where I can apply my technical and analytical skills to drive data-driven decision-making. Apart from my professional interests, I enjoy playing cricket and listening to music, which help me stay active and refreshed."
